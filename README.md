# MNIST-Classification-Project 
Using the MNIST dataset, this Python project creates a basic feedforward neural network for handwritten digit classification. The network offers an introduction to deep learning using PyTorch by being trained to identify and predict numbers (0â€“9) based on their pixel representation.
# features 
- Device Compatibility: If a GPU is available, it is automatically detected and used; if not, the CPU is used.
- An example of a feedforward neural network is one that has:

    ReLU activation and 128 neurons make up one hidden layer.
    Ten neurons (one for each digit) make up the output layer.

- Instruction and Assessment:

    use an optimizer and loss function to train on the MNIST dataset.
    assesses the accuracy of the model using a test dataset.

Visualization: Shows genuine labels next to predictions on a small sample of test photos.

# Getting Started 
Requirements:- 
Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
    torch
    torchvision
    matplotlib 
  You can install these libraries using pip: pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
# Usage Running the Code
The script performs the following tasks:
- Downloads the MNIST dataset and preprocesses it.
- Trains the neural network for 5 epochs (default).
- Evaluates the model's accuracy on the test set.
- Saves the trained model to disk for later use.
- Visualizes predictions on a small batch of test samples.

# OutPut 
Epoch 1/5, Loss: 0.3001
Epoch 2/5, Loss: 0.1205 
with 98,20% accuracy the displays test images is true and predicted the correct labels.
